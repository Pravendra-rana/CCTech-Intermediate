Task : Calculate simple interest 
formula : (principle * interest rate * time)/100
    
    Test Cases
    if time = 1 year, rate of interest = 4.5, principle amount = 10000 then simple interest != 45
    if time = 1 year, rate of interest = 4.5, principle amount = 10000 then simple interest = 450
    if time = 2 year, rate of interest = 4.5, principle amount = 10000 then simple interest = 900
